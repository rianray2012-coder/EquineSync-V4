"""Centralized permission capability map (Phase 4A).

Lightweight RBAC: a *capability* is a ``"resource:action"`` string mapped to the
set of roles allowed to perform it. ``require()`` raises 403 when the capability
is missing; unknown capabilities fail **closed** (deny).

Phase 4A scope: this module is DEFINED + unit-tested, and ``require_setup_role``
is re-expressed through it (behavior-IDENTICAL: admin/barn_manager => "barn:manage").
Broad wiring into routes and any tightening of policy is deferred to Phase 4C.
Do NOT add restrictions here that would change current behavior.
