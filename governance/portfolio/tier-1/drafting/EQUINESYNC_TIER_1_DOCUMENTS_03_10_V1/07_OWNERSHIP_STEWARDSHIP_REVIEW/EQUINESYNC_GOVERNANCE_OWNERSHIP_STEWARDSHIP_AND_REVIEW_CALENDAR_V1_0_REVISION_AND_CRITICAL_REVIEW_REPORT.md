## Issues Found And Changes Made

| Issue class | Severity | Weakness found | Revision made |
|---|---|---|---|
| SOURCE_GROUNDING | P2 | Some historical source references identify paths not present in the protected tree. | Recorded unavailable sources and prohibited exact-byte claims. |
| AUTHORITY_AMBIGUITY | P2 | Draft PRs could be mistaken for adopted or protected current sources. | Added candidate-only treatment in Documents 04, 05, 08, and 09. |
| TEST_EXECUTION_AMBIGUITY | P2 | Repository test files could be mistaken for executed results. | Separated test presence from execution and pass/fail states. |
| OWNER_GAP | P2 | Governance ownership cannot be inferred from artifact family. | Document 07 records assignment evidence gaps and escalation rules. |
| CLOSURE_OVERCLAIM | P2 | A bounded audit could be used to imply portfolio closure. | Document 10 requires scope-bound determinations and certificate limitations. |

## Unresolved Issues

- Current protected source evidence remains distinct from unmerged candidate PR #77 and PR #80.
- Historical source bytes not present in the protected tree remain unavailable until supplied or certified under a valid historical-evidence process.
- Runtime, pilot, production, and executed-test evidence were not created by this documentary package.
- Owner assignments require separate durable assignment evidence.

## Retained Risks

- A future reader could still overclaim adoption, activation, implementation authority, or production readiness if they ignore the authority boundary.
- Source reconciliation remains bounded by protected repository bytes and recorded unmerged candidate context.

## Final Readiness

`READY_FOR_FOUNDER_REVIEW` for Founder review only. This is not adoption, lock, activation, implementation authorization, deployment, pilot, production use, protected-branch mutation, or merge.
